All students must submit an electronic PDF version of the written question including plots generated from the codes. We
{\bf require you to typeset your solutions via \LaTeX}. 
All students must also submit a zip file of
their source code to Gradescope, which should be created using the
\texttt{make\_zip.py} script. You
should make sure to (1) restrict yourself to only using libraries included in
the
\texttt{environment.yml} file, and (2) make sure your code runs without errors.
Your submission may be evaluated by the
auto-grader using a private test set, or used for verifying the outputs reported in the writeup. Please make sure that your PDF file and zip file are submitted to the corresponding Gradescope assignments respectively. We reserve the right to not give any points to the written solutions if the associated code is not submitted.
