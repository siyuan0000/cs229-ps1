With k = 0, the sine part alone already matches the main wave shape.
Higher degrees only make small adjustments; the curve stays smooth and does not show the wild swings we saw in the pure high-degree polynomial. This shows that the sine feature captures the main story, and the extra powers of x are only fine-tuning instead of trying to fit every bit of noise.
